********** Climate Risk Management ********** 

### Climate Risk Management

### Climate Risk Management:
In 2023, we conducted a comprehensive climate risk assessment aligned with TCFD recommendations, evaluating both physical and transition risks across multiple scenarios. Key findings include potential water stress at 12% of our facilities and regulatory risks related to carbon pricing in key markets. We have integrated these findings into our enterprise risk management processes and developed mitigation strategies.

Our comprehensive Climate Risk Management and Water Risk Management frameworks have positioned us to better navigate environmental challenges. We've expanded our protection of critical forest ecosystems while enhancing the health and wellbeing of our employees worldwide.

### Climate Risk Management
Our Climate Risk Management framework includes:
- Physical and transition risk assessment aligned with TCFD
- Climate scenario analysis examining impacts under 1.5°C, 2.0°C, and 3.5°C scenarios
- Adaptation measures implemented at high-risk facilities
- Integration of climate considerations into strategic planning and investment decisions
- Regular climate risk reporting to executive leadership and Board

### Climate Risk Management
In 2022, we conducted climate scenario analysis aligned with TCFD recommendations. Our analysis evaluated physical and transition risks under 1.5°C, 2°C, and 3°C warming scenarios through 2050. Key findings include:
- Physical risks: Increased water stress at 35% of facilities; supply chain disruptions due to extreme weather; changing customer needs due to drought and flooding patterns
- Transition risks: Carbon pricing impacts in key markets; shifts in technology preferences; changing regulatory requirements
- Opportunities: Growing demand for water reuse and efficiency solutions; increased need for climate-resilient water infrastructure

## Looking Forward
In 2024, we will focus on:
- Accelerating decarbonization across our value chain
- Expanding traceability systems to 100% of high-risk commodities
- Enhancing Climate Risk Management and Water Risk Management capabilities
- Increasing support for forest conservation and restoration
- Strengthening employee health initiatives and diversity programs

**Investors**
- Engagement methods: ESG roadshows, analyst briefings, annual meeting, direct engagement
- Key topics raised: Climate risk management, ESG governance, supply chain resilience
- Our response: Enhanced TCFD disclosures, Board sustainability committee, supply chain risk mitigation

********** Water Risk Management ********** 

### Water Risk Management
Our comprehensive Water Risk Management approach includes:
- Facility-level water risk assessments using WRI Aqueduct
- 25% reduction in water withdrawal since 2020
- Water management plans for all facilities in water-stressed areas
- Water recycling systems at major processing facilities
- Participation in watershed management collaboratives in key basins

### Water Risk Management
In 2022, we updated our global water risk assessment using the WRI Aqueduct tool and site-specific analyses. We identified 6 facilities in high or extremely high water-stressed areas, representing 28% of our production. For these sites, we have implemented comprehensive water stewardship plans that include:
- Enhanced water efficiency targets (30% reduction by 2025)
- Water recycling systems with minimum 60% reuse
- Community water projects in surrounding watersheds
- Engagement with local stakeholders on shared water challenges

Our comprehensive Climate Risk Management and Water Risk Management frameworks have positioned us to better navigate environmental challenges. We've expanded our protection of critical forest ecosystems while enhancing the health and wellbeing of our employees worldwide.
